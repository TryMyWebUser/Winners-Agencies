                        <p class="team-details__text-3">PPS is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic that exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical resistance. It can withstand continuous use temperatures up to 240°C and resists degradation by solvents, acids, and bases. PPS also offers dimensional stability, flame retardancy, and high strength, making it ideal for demanding environments. It is commonly used in automotive parts (like under-the-hood components), electrical/electronic applications, appliances, and filtration systems. PPS is often reinforced with glass fibers to enhance its mechanical properties.</p>

                        <p class="team-details__text-3">PVC, or Polyvinyl Chloride, is a durable, versatile thermoplastic used in both rigid and flexible forms. PVC compounds are tailored formulations of PVC resin mixed with plasticizers, stabilizers, and other additives to enhance specific performance requirements. Rigid PVC is used in pipes, profiles, and building materials, while flexible PVC is used in cable insulation, hoses, and synthetic leather. It offers excellent fire resistance, chemical stability, and weatherability. PVC compounds are economical and widely used in construction, healthcare, automotive, and consumer products.</p>

                        <p class="team-details__text-3">Reprocessed polymers are materials recovered from post-industrial or post-consumer plastic waste, which are cleaned, re-melted, and extruded into usable forms. These materials help reduce the environmental impact of plastic production by minimizing landfill waste and conserving natural resources. Although reprocessed polymers may have lower mechanical strength compared to virgin materials, they are suitable for a wide range of non-critical applications such as packaging, containers, garden tools, and furniture. They play a crucial role in promoting sustainable manufacturing practices.</p>

                        <p class="team-details__text-3">Masterbatches are concentrated mixtures of additives or pigments encapsulated in a carrier resin, which is then mixed with base polymers during processing. They allow for uniform dispersion of colorants or functional additives like UV stabilizers, flame retardants, anti-static agents, and lubricants. Masterbatches are used to enhance the appearance and performance of plastic products without altering their basic properties. They simplify the manufacturing process, improve consistency, and are widely used in packaging, construction, agriculture, and consumer goods industries.</p>
